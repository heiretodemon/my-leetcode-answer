question:

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves
back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left),
U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false

answer:
bool judgeCircle(char* moves) {
    int a=0,b=0;
    int i=0;
    while(moves[i]!=NULL)
    {
        switch(moves[i])
        {
                case'R':
                a++;
                break;
                case'L':
                a--;
                break;
                case'U':
                b++;
                break;
                case'D':
                b--;
                break;
        }
        i++;
    }
    if(a==0&&b==0)
        return true;
    else 
        return false;
}
