The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 2^31

Example:
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.


Code:
int hammingDistance(int x,int y) {
    int count=0;
    int j=1;
    for(int i=0;i<31;i++)
    {
        if((x&j)!=(y&j))
            count++;
        x=x>>1;
        y=y>>1;
    }
    return count;
}
